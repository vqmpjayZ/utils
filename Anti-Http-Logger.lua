ANTI HTTP LOGGER
Prevents all kinds of HTTP logging methods and is completely invisible and undetected.
Should work on all executors, apart from Codex, since it tends to break on obfuscated code.

* Note: the script is obfuscated so that there's less of a chance of it getting bypassed. Hope you understand.
Features:
- Reliable and silent anti-HTTP logger
- Never seen before method
- Quick termination and kick-on detection
- Quick detection for clipboards, files, console, rconsole*? and GUIs of all types
- Compatible with a lot of executors, including Xeno/Solara (*may lag a bit on these executors)
- Constant monitoring
- Prevents Function hook restoration and tampering

(It's hard to explain how advanced the script is without saying how it works directly)
